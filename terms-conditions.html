              <p>THIS TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”) constitutes a legally binding agreement by and between
                DESIGN THAT, LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the Republic of Poland
                (“Design That”) and the client, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“Client”), with regard to
                access and use of Design That’s website: <a href="index.htm">https://www.design-that.com/</a> (the
                “Website”) and any other media form, channel, mobile website or mobile application related, linked or
                otherwise connected thereto. Failure to agree and adhere to all of the terms, conditions and obligations
                contained herein results in the express prohibition of the Client’s use of the Website, and the Client
                is ordered to discontinue use immediately. Thereafter the relationship between Client and Design That
                shall cease and be of no further force and effect between the parties, except that any obligation of
                Client to pay Design That for services rendered shall remain and continue to be an ongoing obligation
                owed by Client to Design That.</p>
              <h4>1. Intellectual Property Rights</h4>
              <p>Unless otherwise indicated, the Website is the property of Design That and all source code, databases,
                functionality, software, website designs, audio, video, text, photographs and graphics of any nature and
                regardless of format (herein, collectively or individually, the “Content”) and the trademarks, service
                marks, and logos contained there (the “Marks”) are owned and controlled by Design That and are protected
                by copyright and trademark laws and any other applicable intellectual property law or regulation of the
                Republic of Poland, foreign jurisdictions and international conventions. The Content and Marks are
                provided “As-Is” for your information and personal use only. Except as expressly provided herein, no
                part of the Website and no Content may be copied, reproduced, aggregated, republished, uploaded, posted,
                displayed, encoded, translated, transmitted, distributed, sold, licensed, or otherwise exploited for any
                commercial purpose whatsoever, without Design That’s express prior written permission. Design That
                reserves all rights in the Website, Content and Marks.</p>
              <h4>2. Ownership of Materials</h4>
              <p>Notwithstanding Design That’s ownership of Submissions, as described in Paragraph 4 (“Client
                Feedback”), all design and original source files created on Client’s behalf (“Projects”) belong to
                Client, and Client shall be the sole owner of the copyright for all Projects. In the event that any
                operation of law would cause Design That to become the owner of a Project, in whole or in part, rather
                than Client, Design That irrevocably and perpetually assigns its entire interest in the Project to
                Client, without limitation. Client warrants that any and all materials provided to Design That as
                examples or as material to be incorporated into a project during the design process are owned by Client
                and do not infringe on or misappropriate any third party’s rights, including, but not limited to, all
                intellectual property rights and any right of publicity. Design That always reserves the right to share
                the Client&#x27;s design work publicly (social media, website, etc.) unless agreed upon as stated in
                section 18 of this document.</p>
              <h4>3. Third-Party Fonts</h4>
              <p>In the event that any Project incorporates fonts that are not owned by Design That and require a
                commercial license in order for Client to legally reproduce, distribute, or publicly display the Project
                (“Third-Party Font(s)”), Design That will inform Client in writing that one or more Third-Party Fonts
                have been incorporated into the Project and that Client will need to purchase one or more licenses for
                the Third-Party Fonts from the rights-holder(s) of said Third Party Fonts in order to legally reproduce,
                distribute, or publicly display the Project. Said notice will include information sufficient for Client
                to identify which licenses are required and who to contact in order to purchase said licenses. So long
                as Design That has informed Client of the incorporation of Third-Party Fonts as described above, Client
                assumes all responsibility for any consequences as a result of a failure by Client to purchase one or
                more licenses for any Third-Party Fonts incorporated into a Project.</p>
              <h4>4. User Representations</h4>
              <p>By using the Website, Client represents and warrants that:</p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li>Client has the legal capacity and agrees to comply with these Terms of Use;</li>

                <li>Client will not access the Website through automated or non-human means;</li>
                <li>Client will not use the Website for any illegal or unauthorized purpose;</li>
                <li>Client’s use of the Website will not violate any applicable law or regulation.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>5. Prohibited Activities</h4>

                made available to the Client. The Website may not be used in connection with any commercial endeavors
                except those related to the work performed by Design That on behalf of the Client. Further, Client
                agrees to refrain from the following:</p>
              <ul role="list">

                <li>Decipher, decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer any of the software comprising or in any way
                  making up a part of the Website;</li>
                <li>Bypass any measures on the Website designed to prevent or restrict access to the Website or any
                  portion thereof;</li>
                <li>Harass, annoy, intimidate or threaten any of Design That’s employees, independent contractors or
                  agents providing services through the Website;</li>
                <li>Delete the copyright or other rights notice from any Content;</li>
                <li>Copy or adapt the Website’s software;</li>
                <li>Upload or transmit, or attempt to do so, viruses, Trojan horses, or other material including

                <li>Use the Website in a manner inconsistent with any applicable laws, statutes or regulations.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>6. Client Feedback</h4>
              <p>Client acknowledges and agrees that any questions, comments, suggestions or other feedback or
                submission (each a “Submission”) shall be the sole property of Design That and Design That is under no
                obligation to keep a Submission confidential or take steps necessary to ensure the confidentiality of a
                Submission. Design That shall be the sole and exclusive owner of all rights related to the Submission
                except to the extent that rights are granted to Client under Paragraph 2 (“Ownership of Materials”), and
                shall at its sole and unrestricted discretion use and disseminate a Submission for any lawful purpose
                without permission, acknowledgment or compensation of or to the Client. Client agrees that it has the
                right to articulate and put forth the Submission and Client hereby waives all claims and recourse
                against Design That for its use of the Submission in accordance with the terms hereof and in its sole
                discretion hereafter.</p>
              <h4>7. Management and Oversite</h4>
              <p>Design That reserves the right to monitor the Website for violations of these Terms of Use and to take
                appropriate legal action in response to a violation of the Terms of Use or any applicable law, statute
                or regulation. Design That further reserves the right to restrict or deny access to the Website or
                disable the Client’s use of the Website. Such decision shall be in the sole discretion of Design That,
                without notice or liability to Client. All decisions regarding the management of the Website shall be at

                and are prohibited from being used by the Client in any way.</p>

                Issues with hardware, software or other items may result in interruption delays or errors beyond Design
                That’s control. Client agrees that Design That shall not be liable to Client for any loss, damage or
                inconvenience caused by Client’s inability to access or use the Website during any interruption in the
                connection or service.</p>
              <h4>12. Governing Law</h4>

                of any such data and Client hereby waives any right of action against Design That from any such loss or
                corruption.</p>
              <h4>17. Electronic communications, transactions and signatures</h4>
              <p>Client hereby consents to receive electronic communications from Design That and Client agrees that all
                agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications sent via email or through the Website satisfy
                any legal requirement that such communication be in writing. Client hereby agrees to the use of
                electronic signatures, contracts, orders and other records, and to electronic delivery of notices,
                policies and records of transactions initiated or completed by Design That or through the Website.
                Client hereby waives any rights or requirements under any statutes, regulations, rules, ordinances or
                other laws in any jurisdiction which require an original signature or delivery or retention of

              <p>These Terms of Use and any policies posted on the Website or regarding the Website constitute the
                entire agreement and understanding between the Client and Design That. Failure of Design That to enforce
                any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.
                If any provision or part of these Terms of Use is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, that
                provision shall be severed from these Terms of Use but shall not otherwise affect the validity or
                unenforceability of the remaining provisions herein. Nothing in these Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy
                or on the Website shall be construed to constitute the forming of a joint venture, partnership,
                employment or agency relationship between Client and Design That.</p>
